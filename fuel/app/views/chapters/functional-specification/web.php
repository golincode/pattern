				<p>Things to consider for building a functional specification for a web project:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Navigation – how the user gets about the site</li>
					<li>User authentication – does the user sign in at any point</li>
					<li>Devices – what kind of devices is the user likely to use</li>
				</ul>
