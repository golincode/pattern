                <p>You can manage the pattern however suits your way of working and the style of project. You can either put everything in the pattern into one document, or keep them as separate working documents.</p>
                <p>It is advisable to use version control with dates (rather than just dates) for documents. Keep your master document undated (<em>eg</em> ‘Functional Specification.indd’) then create a PDF for each edition that you publish using version control.</p>
                <p>Using version control rather than dates has various advantages:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Better understanding of what has changed between versions</li>
                    <li>Less likely to over-write other files</li>
                    <li>ISO9001 verified</li>
                    <li>More than one file can be created per day</li>
                    <li>Easier to search for</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 id="creating-documents-1">What is version control?</h2>
                <p>A two- or three-part number, <em>eg</em> 1.5.2, which is major.minor.revision.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The first part is called the <strong>major</strong> version is will likely never change while you’re working on a new project, unless you need to start that document from scratch. However, when you re-visit a project and move into the next phase, that is likely to then start with the next major version.</li>
                    <li>The second part is the <strong>minor</strong> version. This is normally when you’ve put something new into that document, or have re-written an entire part. If you’ve moved something around substantially that would also cause to knock up a minor version.</li>
                    <li>The third (and optional) part is the <strong>revision</strong> number. This is used for tweaks that you might make after you’ve published a minor version.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Numbers don’t automatically round up when you get to 9. For example after 1.5.9 is 1.5.10, and after 1.6.25 might be 1.7.0. Think of each part as it’s own number.</p>
                <p>An ‘Objectives &amp; Scope’ document starts as 1.0.0, but with missing elements. Once they’ve been added in, 1.1.0 is created. A few amendments need to be made after a meeting, so they are made and 1.1.1 is created. This is sent to the client, which we receive feedback on and make more amendments bringing it up to 1.2.1.</p>
                <p>After this scenario, the following files will exist:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Objectives &amp; Scope.indd</li>
                    <li>Objectives &amp; Scope 1.0.0.pdf</li>
                    <li>Objectives &amp; Scope 1.1.0.pdf</li>
                    <li>Objectives &amp; Scope 1.1.1.pdf</li>
                    <li>Objectives &amp; Scope 1.2.1.pdf</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you still prefer to see the date in the filename, please put this after the version number.</p>
