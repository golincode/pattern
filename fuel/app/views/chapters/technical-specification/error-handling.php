<p>
	List the different errors a user might come up against while using the application, and how they should be handled.
</p>

<p>
	For example:
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>404</strong> - when a page is not found, display a page that shows the user their error in a friendly and useful way
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>validation</strong> - how should the application deal with invalid or bad data?
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>javascript</strong> - if an application has a part of it that has a specific requirement (ie. javascript, flash, etc.) how should this be dealt with?
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>general error (500)</strong> - how should the application deal with all other errors?
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>
