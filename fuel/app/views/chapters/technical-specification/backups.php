				<h2>Recovery Time Objective (RTO)</h2>
				<p>The duration of time it takes for the service to recover. This is typically five working days, but a client may wish to pay for a quicker turn around.</p>

				<h2>Recovery Point Objective (RPO)</h2>
				<p>How much data one is prepared to loose. For example, if the system is backed up every 24 hours at midnight, and the server crashes at 11.59pm, youâ€™d loose 11 hours and 59 minutes of data, as the last backup will be from midnight the day before.</p>
				<p>A typical RPO might be seven days, but 24 hours could be arranged.</p>
