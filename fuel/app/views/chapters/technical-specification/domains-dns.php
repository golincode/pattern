				<p>
					<strong>NB</strong> Don’t buy domain names for a client 
					without their explicit permission. Some clients have to 
					own the domain names in order to use them, and transferring 
					them back is sometimes costly and adds a delay.
				</p>
				<p>List domains used for each environment, who’s responsible for buying them if applicable, and who manages the DNS.</p>
				<p>Explain the relationship between the nameservers and records, who is responsible for them and suggest what they should be.</p>
				<p>Remember, all records should now include IPv6 addresses. If the server doesn’t support IPv6, make a note for future reference.</p>
