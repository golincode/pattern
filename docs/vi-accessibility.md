The following guidelines will be adhered to to ensure accessible access for all.

Our recommendations come from the W3C’s Web Accessibility Initiative’s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0.

### Text Alternatives

Any text-content not written as text (such as in an image) should have a suitable text alternative. If content is for cosmetic’s sake, it should not be presented to users using assistive technology. **LEVEL A**


### Time-based Media

The option for a non-media based version of the media should be available. The application will allow the use of text to be made available with a video. **LEVEL A**


If content is live, such as a live stream, captions should be available to the user. **LEVEL AA**


### Adaptable

Information about structure or relationship should be made available through text only and should not rely on a view. Make full use of Lists, Tables and Navigation to let the user know what’s happening. **LEVEL A**

Use a meaningful sequence to a page, so that content flows from top to bottom. **LEVEL A**


### Distinguishable

Colour should not be used as the only way of indication of information. **LEVEL A** (Note that colour can be used on top of other techniques.)

The contrast of text must be at least 4.5:1, except for large text (3:1), decoration and logotypes. **LEVEL AA**

Text should be able to be scaled by 200% using the browser features only without the website breaking. **LEVEL AA**


### Keyboard Accessible

All functions on the site can be used without requiring specific keyboard inputs, such as timed intervals. **LEVEL A**

There are no “keyboard traps” where as user cannot escape an input box. **LEVEL A**


### Enough Time

If a time limit is placed on a page, the user must be able to turn it off, adjust it or extend it; unless it is real-time, becomes invalid (such as an auction) or is longer than 20 hours. **LEVEL A**

Any content that moves, blinks or scrolls automatically should either have an option to pause, stop or hide it. **LEVEL A**

No content should flash more than three times in one second. **LEVEL A**


### Navigable

Each page should have a “skip to content” option available to users with assistive devices. **LEVEL A**

Pages should be titled that describe the content or purpose. **LEVEL A**

The order of navigation should be sequential and in an order that has meaning. **LEVEL A**

A link’s purpose should be clear from the text, words such as “Click Here” should never be used. **LEVEL A**

Content should be accessible from more than once place, such as primary and secondary navigation, related content, site map or table of contents. **LEVEL AA**

Headings and labels are used and are appropriate. **LEVEL A**

The keyboard focus is visible. **LEVEL AA**


### Readable

Every page should include data about the language used, such as English. **LEVEL A**

Wherever another language is used inside the page’s language, that data should be included. **LEVEL AA**


### Predictable

When an element receives focus, it does not change context. **LEVEL A**

Changing a element does not automatically change the context unless the user has been told before. **LEVEL AA**

Navigation patterns are repeated across the site. **LEVEL AA**

Components use the same functionality across the site. **LEVEL AA**

If the user submits data that is invalid, the error should be clearly shown. **LEVEL A**

Labels and instructions are given wherever the user requires input. **LEVEL A**

If the user submits data that is invalid but a suggestion is possible, it should be presented. **LEVEL A**

Content that has legal commitments (such as financial), a system should allow the user to undo her work. Content should be either reversible, checked or confirmed. **LEVEL AA**


### Conformance

Wherever conformance to AA is not possible, a suitable alternative should be made available
