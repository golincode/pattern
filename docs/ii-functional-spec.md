title: Functional Specification

---

The functional parts of your project – what it does. Justify what it does by referring to what goal it helps achieve.

This is where you describe the ‘what’ and ‘why’ of your project.

Once the functional specification has been written, it should be handed to the Lead Developer and Lead Designer, who should critique it. This cycle should continue until all functions have been thought-through and written down.

The Lead Developer can then answer the functional specification with a technical specification. It may not be necessary to show the client the technical one, but the functional specification should be shown to and agreed with the client. Once the client has given feedback, the cycle can begin again.

### Web development

Things to consider for building a functional specification for a web project:

- Navigation – how the user gets about the site
- User authentication – does the user sign in at any point
- Devices – what kind of devices is the user likely to use

### App development

Things to consider for building a functional specification for an app project:

- Devices – what type and age of device will the user be using
- Distribution – what app stores will the app appear on, who manages that and the implications of relying on them
