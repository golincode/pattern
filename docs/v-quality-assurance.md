### Unit Testing

Often no extra unit testing will be required, but list that it is available in the framework provided.

### Security Testing

List any particular details that will require resting, such as the SSL if needed.

List a contact on the client’s end and one at Golin who are responsible for any changes made. Often this will be the project manager. This ensures that two different people aren’t making different changes to the application.
