Use this as a check list of things to remember on the run up to go live. These are suggestions, but do add your own as you develop the project.

### Analytics

Record who needs to arrange the analytics and how far in advance they need to set it up.

### Server

Who is responsible for commissioning servers and when they need to do it. This might also include setting up testing and staging servers.

### SSL Certificates

Who is responsible for buying the SSL and installing it, and how far this has to be done in advance. SSLs can be difficult, so it’s often good to leave 10 working days to get together.

### DNS

List the contact and how much notice they need to make any DNS changes necessary for the go live.

### Sprint

Anything that needs reminding in the 24 hours up to and after the go live.

### Review

When all the dust has settled down, what’ll need checking to make sure it worked. Often this is analytics and emails.
