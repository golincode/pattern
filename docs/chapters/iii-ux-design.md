User Experience and Design defines the look and feel of the project. It’s difficult to describe the full scope of the project in design, so stick to answering as much of the requirements as possible.

### Use Cases & User Stories

#### Use Cases

Use cases are a string of steps a user takes to perform an action. Take the goals of the project and define how users achieve those goals. They let you look at a specific site or journey from many angles.

> Buying a product from Amazon
> - Search for a product or use categories to browse
> - View product information
> - Add product to basket
> - Checkout basket
> - Receive confirmation of purchase
> - User Stories
{: .example }

#### User stories

Describe the actions for each type of user that would use the project.

> As a frequent visitor, I want to be able to stay signed in for 30 days.
{: .example }

or

> As a new visitor, I want to be sign up to create a wish list.
{: .example }

User Stories are very useful for development and testing, and are useful for the client to imagine the user journey. They don’t have to be totally comprehensive of the entire site, just the main purposes.

### Creative Brief

Get an idea from the client of the design for the project. Brand guidelines should dictate much of the standards, and the design should answer the functional specification (for example, if the requirement is to build a mobile application, the appropriate considerations will be taken into).

### Design Process

You should describe to the client how the design process works.

List how many rounds of feedback are included and how long that process should last.

### Typefaces

Take note of typefaces and their weights. Recommend where they should be used an in what context. List where the sources for the typefaces (such as the client, or a service like TypeKit). Any licences required should be referred to here.

### Provided Assets

Describe what assets you’re expecting to receive from the client and at what stage.

### Brand Guidelines and Copy Style

Take notes and provide a reference to brand guidelines and the style of copy. For the project, agree on how the project name and related entities should be written. For example, is it ‘iPhone’ or ‘I-phone’?
