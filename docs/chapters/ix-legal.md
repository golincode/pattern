### Licenses

A license for each library, framework or software included with the application being built must be recorded. Place each license as a text file in a ‘Licenses’ folder in ‘Admin’.

The format for each license is as follows:
[Software] [Software version] [Licence + version].txt

PHP 7.0.0 The PHP License 3.01.txt
jQuery 1.9.1 MIT License.txt
Remember to take note of the software version and the license number, if applicable.

If two pieces of software use the same license (for example, MIT) you must include one for each piece of software in full.
