The first thing to outline is the point of the project, why the client wants it, who’s going to do it and what they’re trying to achieve. Some of these points are painfully obvious, but this document should help anybody that hasn’t ever seen the project before get right up to speed.

## Purpose

Describe as simply as possibly the purpose of this project.

> The Hub makes it easier for market managers to use the correct assets in campaigns.

Or

> The iPod allows people to listen to music from their computers on the go.

## Objectives

Outline the objectives as individual points. For simple projects there is likely only to be a few points. Do not offer any conclusions or solutions at this point, merely outline what we’re trying to achieve.

> - Users should add products to a basket.
> - Users should then checkout the contents of their basket.
> etc

or

> - Allow users to transfer songs from their computer to the iPod.
> - Allow users to find songs on the iPod using different categories.
> etc

## Life Cycle

Describe a time line of the project, including phases. Mention the scope that your project contains, for example just phase 1.

If the project is relatively simple, this section can be omitted.

## Supplied

It is likely that copy, assets or other content is provided by the client. List what you’re expecting the client to provide.

> Photography of staff and shop provided in JPG format with a minimum resolution of 4 megapixels.
> Copy for all content pages.

If the client is providing finished designs they’ve made.

## Deliverables

Normally suspiciously easy this one, what are we going to provide?

> A web application deployed to a web server.

or

> A web page suitable for a Facebook Page tab deployed to a web server.

or

> An iOS application for iPhone and iPod touch distributed to the iOS App Store.

However, sometimes it can be more complicated.

> A concept video with voice over demonstrating the features of the web application, training manuals for staff to use and a web application deployed to a web server.
